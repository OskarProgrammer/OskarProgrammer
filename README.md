- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OskarProgrammer, I am 18 years old man from Poland.
  
- I am learning programming for last 2 years. My first programming language was C++.
  I learnt everything by myself, I am reading a lot of about programming, from books
  dealing with the basics of programming languages â€‹â€‹to those additional specialized topics
  related to programming, for example about TDD, asyncio, black hat python, java spring, effective C,
  arduino robots, mysql.

- I really enjoyed reading:
    Black Hat Python -> Justin Seitz & Tim Arnold
    Effective C. Introduction to proffesional programming -> Robert C. Seacord
    Champion of C language. The best rules and patterns -> Christopher Preschern
    Algorithms. Ilustrated guide -> Aditya Y. Bhargava
    Python code in one line -> Christian Mayer

- I use code editor Visual Studio Code to create my projects and recently I am a
  linux user, which makes my work much easier, especially the BASH terminal.
  For java programming I use jetbrains IDE IntelliJ IDEA.
  
  Linux: PopOS
  Editor: Visual Studio Code
  IDE: IntelliJ IDEA

  I love ![b4q69mrtlgi4qgcplkeq](https://github.com/OskarProgrammer/OskarProgrammer/assets/130141327/ad53a1fe-08cb-41bd-9691-70143036d180)


  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything about programming, from creating easy scripts to building advanced communication systems or servers.
-  Iâ€™m currently learning cybersecurity, algorithms and asyncio programming.
  
- In the future I really want to learn:
- Assembly language, React.js, Java Spring.
  
- I already know the basics of:
- C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Julia, Haskell, Assembly, Ruby, BASH, Linux, Structured Query Language, Go lang.

- I know advanced structures of:
- Python, C.
