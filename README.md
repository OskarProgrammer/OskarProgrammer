- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Oskar, I am 18 years old man from Poland.

  ![polish-flag-8](https://github.com/OskarProgrammer/OskarProgrammer/assets/130141327/7b5aa5fd-03ab-4f52-ba62-4c8d002559fa)

  I am learning programming for last 2 years.
  My first programming language was C++.
  I learnt everything by myself.
  I read a lot of about programming, from books dealing with the basics of programming languages â€‹â€‹to those additional specialized topics
  related to programming, for example about TDD, asyncio, black hat python, java spring, effective C, arduino robots, mysql.

- I really enjoyed reading:
  
    Black Hat Python -> Justin Seitz & Tim Arnold
  
    Effective C. Introduction to proffesional programming -> Robert C. Seacord
  
    Champion of C language. The best rules and patterns -> Christopher Preschern
  
    Algorithms. Ilustrated guide -> Aditya Y. Bhargava
  
    Python code in one line -> Christian Mayer
  


- I use code editor Visual Studio Code to create my projects and recently I am a
  linux user, which makes my work much easier, especially the BASH terminal.
  For java programming I use jetbrains IDE IntelliJ IDEA.
  
  Linux: PopOS
  
  Editor: Visual Studio Code

  IDE: IntelliJ IDEA

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything about programming, from creating easy scripts to building advanced communication systems or servers.
  
  Iâ€™m currently learning cybersecurity, algorithms and asyncio programming.



  
- In the future I really want to learn:
  
  Assembly language, React.js, Java Spring.



  
- I already know the basics of:
  
  C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Julia, Haskell, Assembly, Ruby, BASH, Linux, Structured Query Language, Go lang.




- I know advanced structures of:
  
  Python, C.
